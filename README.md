# Ticket-to-Ride-Shortest-Path
Trying out various shortest path algorithms on the board game "Ticket to Ride". May add more algorithms specific to the game later.

Map:

To use the code edit the following lines

The start and end values can be changed to any city name from the map. You can also add edges (tracks) to the blockedTracks vector to simulate people taking tracks. The same can be done with the blockedStations vector.

The code building the map can also be changed to match the other versions of this game, or similar graphs.
